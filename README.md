## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate and pragmatic software engineer with hands-on experience in backend systems and modern web development. 

I enjoy solving complex problems, writing clean code, and continuously learning new tools and technologies.

I work fluently in English and Polish, and I’ve also been actively using German in professional and collaborative contexts.

I am currently pursuing BSc in Computer Science -> graduation in 2026.
